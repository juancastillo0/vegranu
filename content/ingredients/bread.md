## Sourdough Starter

The starter provides the active yeast to kickstart the fermentation process. It usually takes 7 days of "feeding" for the sourdough starter to be ready for properly fermenting and leavening the dough.

### Steps

- Take a glass container and a spatula or spoon to stir the mix
- Add a 1 1/2 tablespoon of whole wheat or rye flour with 1 tablespoon of water to the container and mix. Leave the container covered for 1 day
- The next day, store half the starter (sourdough discard) for other uses (pancakes) and add the same ingredients as the previous day. Mix and leave for 1 day
- Repeat the previous step for 5 more days
- The starter should be active enough to double in size, which can be measured by putting a rubber band around the glass container
- Keep feeding the starter or store it in the fridge if you don't plan on baking in the coming days.
  - You should feed the starter for 1-2 days before baking to activate it

## Whole Wheat Bread

### Steps

- The night before baking, add 50g of starter to 100g of both, water and flour
- In the morning, add the fed starter to 100g of water and 2 tablespoons of sugar, stir and wait 5 minutes for the mix to activate
- Add the flour and water to the mix and knead the flour for 15 minutes 
  - If, by the 10 minute mark, the texture does not seem appropriate, add more water or flour and knead some more to incorporate
- Leave to rise for 4 hours in a floured and covered container so the dough does not stick or dry out
- Split and fold the dough to the final shape and place it in a container for 6 hours
  - You may add other ingredients when folding
- Heat the oven to 210-230C and put the dough for 30-40 minutes in a sealed container or with water so it does not burn
- Decrease the temperature to 190-210C and uncover the bread or remove the water. Leave in the over for 20-30 minutes to finish the bake and for the crust to develop
- Take out the bread and leave it to cool off in a rack for 1 hour or until cool
- Store in the fridge or freezer. Outside it may last 3-7 days, depending on the sourness, dryness and other ingredients.
