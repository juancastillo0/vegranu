## Tips

- Sunflower seed are a cost effective way to introduce some fat and variety in texture and nutrition
- Chia and Flax are great for a thicker texture and  they contain a high omega-3 and fiber content. You can also use corn meal or equivalent to increase the thickness
- You can find some beautiful glass bottles for fridge storage
- A multi-functional pot which then can be used for making yogurt 

## Storage

- Up to 3 days in the fridge
- Can be freezed in silicone bags. Let it thaw and throw it in the blender when you are ready for a refill.

## Recipe

- Leave the nuts, seeds and grains soaking overnight or for a couple of hours. You may speed up the process by heating up the water
- With a strainer, remove the water
- Add the ingredients along with the water to a blender
- Boil for 20 minutes. Mix to distribute the heat and keep the bottom from burning. May use a big pot with more water so you don't need to attachment  
- Add to a blender with more water until you find the proper consistency. If you plan on making yogurt or ice-cream, you may set aside some of the liquid without adding more water to keep that smooth gesture  
- Let it cool and store
